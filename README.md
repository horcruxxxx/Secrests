### `NOTE :` The main purpose of the project was to impliment 7 levels of security to the Backend, thus Frontend is ignored.

• A Web Application that allows userto share their Secrets anonymously.

• Salting and Hashing Passwords Using Bycrypt algorithm.

• Integrated Passport.js to add cookies and sessions and enable seamless
user authentication.

• Implemented third party sign in using Oauth, a key challenge in creating a
user-friendly and intuitive app.
